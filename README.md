# QT_xml
 Development of a program that displays XML files in the form of a hierarchical table.  
The program provides a menu (QMenu) containing the following items:  

File:  
Open (loading xml data file)  
Close All (Clear the data output area)  
Exit (Close the program)  

Implemented a context menu for the root element (i.e. "Open file name without full path") with the field "Make file active", "Open file in a new window".  
There is an input field for XQuery queries and a "Execute" button.
